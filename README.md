## Summary

- Describe one drawback of this new design and two recommendations for further development:

- The primary drawback I see with this design is that the data entered into the filter boxes are case sensitive. If the user uses a different case when entering data for city or state, for example, there is no filtered data returned in the table.

Improvements to the design:
- allow for alternative cases when searching for text.
- allow for real-time searching as the user is entering the text. The table can be filtering with each letter as it is typed.
